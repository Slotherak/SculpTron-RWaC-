# SculpTron-RWaC-
The New Version of the RWaC initiative program, AZATHOTH!

This originally was going to be a GP Blocks project. However, although that door hasn't fully shut yet, it is definitely blocked off. Maybe we can excavate the doorway later.

This will be made in Processing, a spin-off library of the good old Java programming language. It has full compatibility with Raspberry Pis, and Arduino was built with Processing, so this will be the one we use.

After we get the license decided and cemented, we'll start making code for the product again, and we'll hopefully get back to where we left off, and possibly further too.
